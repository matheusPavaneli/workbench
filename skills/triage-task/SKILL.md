# triage-task

All tracker access goes through one command. Never construct JQL, WIQL, URLs or
field lists — the provider builds them from the resolved context.

```
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/wb.py" <args>
```

## Steps

0. **Resuming?** `status` first. It lists every ticket with work in flight and
   the one command that moves each on, read off the artifacts on disk. If the
   ticket already has a `triage.json`, do not re-fetch it.

1. **No key given** — `task list`. Four columns, newest first. Show them and ask
   which one, unless the request already names one.

   No tracker in this repo? `task new "title" --type bug|feature|chore|support`
   records it in the local backlog and everything downstream works unchanged.
   Only local contexts accept it; `wb` says so if the repo has a real tracker.

2. **Read it** — `task get <KEY>`. Writes `.workflow/<KEY>/triage.json` and
   prints it. Depth defaults to 1: the task, plus one line per linked item.
   - Use `--depth 0` when the ticket is self-contained and links do not matter.
   - Use `--depth 2` only when a blocker or a parent decides the approach. It
     fetches bodies for blocking and hierarchy links, never for `relates`.

3. **Go deeper only where it pays** — the `_expand` list names what exists but
   was not included. Pass a handle back **verbatim**:
   `task get <KEY> --expand comments:all`. Do not compose handles; anything not
   in `_expand` is rejected.

4. **Check `_unmapped` and `_truncated`** if present. `_unmapped` means the
   tracker had a link type or field this version does not model — say so rather
   than guessing what it meant. `_truncated` means content was capped, and
   names the handle that would retrieve it.

5. **Report gaps before planning.** If the ticket lacks acceptance criteria, a
   reproduction, or a decision someone else owns, list those questions plainly.
   A blocked-by link that is not Done is a gap, not a detail. Write them to
   `.workflow/<KEY>/questions.md` and say the ticket is not ready to plan.

## Rules

- Report what the ticket says, not what it probably means. Missing information
  is a finding to report, never a blank to fill.
- Quote the `key` in every claim so later steps can check it.
- One tracker per context, resolved automatically. If `wb` reports no context,
  relay its fix lines — do not guess a project or a URL.

Next: `plan-change` reads the artifact this produced.
